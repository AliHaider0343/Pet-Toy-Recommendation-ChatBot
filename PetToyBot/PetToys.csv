To keep your chews clean give them a scrub with a brush under warm water, using mild, non-toxic detergent, and rinse thoroughly.

Check your pups chew regularly, make sure its whole and intact, with no missing pieces. Always replace if the knuckle ends are worn down, or if it becomes too small to chew safely.

These non-edible chews are made with nylon. They are NOT intended for consumption.

Not all dogs chew the same way—even dogs of the same size, weight, age, or breed can chew differently. That’s why it’s important to select the best chew toy for your dog based on their weight and chewing style. Once you determined which chew style best suits your furry friend, look for the size on the front corner of the chew toy’s package.

With positive reinforcement, pups will learn that chewing on Nylabone Puppy Chews is not only encouraged, but a fun pastime as they grow and develop.
